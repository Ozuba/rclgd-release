The ros2 rclgd Command
======================

rclgd ships a ``ros2 rclgd`` command (provided by the ``rclgd_cli`` package)
that covers the whole lifecycle of a Godot-ROS package: scaffolding, opening
the editor and diagnosing broken setups.

.. code-block:: text

   ros2 rclgd create <name>    Scaffold a new rclgd package
   ros2 rclgd editor [pkg]     Open the Godot editor on a package's source project
   ros2 rclgd list             List built rclgd packages
   ros2 rclgd doctor           Check the installation and report problems

Tab completion works for verbs, options and built package names.

create
------

Scaffolds a complete, buildable package from the bundled template: a
``package.xml`` with ``build_type: rclgd``, a minimal Godot project, the rclgd
editor addon and a demo publisher/subscriber scene.

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 rclgd create my_bot
   colcon build --packages-select my_bot && source install/setup.bash
   ros2 rclgd editor my_bot     # edit
   ros2 run my_bot my_bot       # run

Useful options:

*   ``--dependencies geometry_msgs sensor_msgs`` — message packages the project
    uses; they become ``<exec_depend>`` entries, and the editor generates typed
    wrappers for them (see :doc:`/tutorials/custom_messages`).
*   ``--renderer gl_compatibility`` — for headless CI machines or weak GPUs
    (default: ``forward_plus``).
*   ``--maintainer-name`` / ``--maintainer-email`` — default to your git config.
*   ``--dry-run`` — print what would be created without writing anything.

Package names must be ``lower_snake_case`` to satisfy ROS 2 naming rules.

editor
------

Opens the Godot editor from the sourced ROS environment, which is what makes
``librclgd.so`` resolve.

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 rclgd editor my_bot     # a built package: opens its *source* project
   ros2 rclgd editor            # inside a project: opens the current directory
   ros2 rclgd editor            # anywhere else: opens the project manager

Given a package name, the verb resolves the package through the ament index
and opens the **source** project — never the installed copy, where edits would
be silently overwritten by the next ``colcon build``.

``--import-only`` runs the headless asset import and exits, which is handy in
CI or after cloning a project whose ``.godot`` folder is (correctly) not
committed.

list
----

Lists every built rclgd package with its install prefix and source location:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ros2 rclgd list
   my_bot	~/ros2_ws/install/my_bot	~/ros2_ws/src/my_bot

``--names-only`` prints one package name per line (script friendly).

doctor
------

Checks the whole chain — ROS environment, ``librclgd.so``, launcher, version
pin, engine binary (exists, runs, matches the pin) and, when run inside a
project, the project's extension wiring and import state. Every failure comes
with a hint:

.. code-block:: text

   $ ros2 rclgd doctor
   ✓ ROS_DISTRO=jazzy, default rmw
   ✓ rclgd sourced from ~/ros2_ws/install/rclgd
   ✓ extension library ~/ros2_ws/install/rclgd/lib/rclgd/librclgd.so
   ✓ godot launcher installed (ros2 run rclgd godot)
   ✓ version pin: Godot 4.7.1
   ✓ godot 4.7.1.stable.official at ~/ros2_ws/install/rclgd/lib/rclgd/godot-bin
   all checks passed
